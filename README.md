# csv_merger
Application that merges two procurement lists into one. If a record exists in both input procurement lists, they'll get summed.
The default location of the procurement lists is C:\csv. The default name of the two lists are procurement list.csv and procurement list (1).csv
The output file is Ã¶sszegzett.csv, which is created in the same folder as the default folder for the input lists, C:\csv

Could be upgraded with a file explorer to browse for the lists.
This is only a console application, unfortunately, but at least it gets the job done. Making this application a bit more elegant and convenient is a future project.
